# Python-Function-Grapher

Code is in Graph Plotter.py

You can change the scale of the graph on line 4 "Scale = " This determines the increment value of each marker line on the graph
Higher number will essentially zoom out

To change the detail level of the graph on line 6 "Detail = " This determines the maximum amount of points plotted between
each marker line on the graph. 
Points are plotted if no point is already placed at a pixel meaning increasing this number will affect vertical detail but increase load times

To change the function change line 14 and 8 (Optional: Line 8 is purely cosmetic) *you can only use x as a variable*
